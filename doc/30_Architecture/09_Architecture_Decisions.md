# Architecture decisions

## Use Kotlin as implementation language

Kotlin is used in Gherkin Runner because of it's readability, null safety and support for functional paradigm.

## Use Groovy as tests-layer language

Gherkin Runner is designed to use Groovy files as tests implementation language, because it is very elastic and allows
to write business readable code as far as it is possible.
